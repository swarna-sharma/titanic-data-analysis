A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset investigating factors that influenced passenger survival rates.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between passenger attributes and survival outcomes. Using statistical methods and data visualization, we explore how gender, class, age, fare, and family relationships affected survival chances during the tragic 1912 maiden voyage.

## 🎯 Key Insights Discovered

- **Gender Impact**: Females had 74.2% survival rate vs 18.9% for males
- **Class Privilege**: 1st class passengers survived at 63% vs 24% in 3rd class  
- **Age Patterns**: Children and elderly passengers had higher survival rates
- **Economic Factor**: Higher fare prices strongly correlated with survival
- **Family Effect**: Moderate family sizes (1-3 members) had optimal survival chances

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Survival distribution by gender and passenger class
- Age and fare distribution analysis
- Correlation heatmaps of all variables
- Family size impact on survival rates
- Interactive pairplots and statistical charts
